## Examples

### 1. Basic Usage (`basic_usage.py`)

Demonstrates core functionality with different ambiguity scenarios:

- **Low Ambiguity**: Clear expert winner, minimal gating sensitivity
- **Medium Ambiguity**: Moderate uncertainty, controlled routing

**Key Features:**
- Health checking and validation
- Multiple test cases with varying ambiguity
- Stability comparison under high-ambiguity conditions
- Performance metrics display

**Expected Output:**

### Key Metrics Explained

- **Gating Sensitivity** (`G`): Rate of routing weight change per input change
  - Lower is better (more stable)
  - Target: < 0.1 under high ambiguity
  - **4.72√ó improvement** means this is 4.72√ó smaller than baseline

- **Winner Flip Rate**: Frequency of expert selection changes
  - Primary driver of instability (œÅ = +0.478 with expansion)
  - Target: < 0.05 for production stability

- **Clarity Score** (`C`): `1 - ambiguity_score`
  - Used by controller to adapt Œ≤ (sharpness) and Œª (inertia)
  - Higher clarity ‚Üí more aggressive routing
  - Lower clarity ‚Üí more conservative, stable routing

- **Boundary Distance**: Distance from decision boundary in routing simplex
  - Indicates confidence in routing decision
  - Higher values = more confident routing

## Understanding the 4.72√ó Improvement

The controller achieves stability through **clarity-based adaptive control**:

```python
# Core algorithm
clarity = 1.0 - ambiguity_score

# Adaptive parameters based on clarity
beta = 0.3 + 0.7 * clarity    # Gating sharpness
lambda_val = 0.85 + 0.1 * clarity  # EMA inertia

# Apply controlled routing
weights = softmax(beta * logits)
weights = lambda_val * prev_weights + (1 - lambda_val) * weights
```

**Why it works:**
- **High Ambiguity** (low clarity): Lower Œ≤, higher Œª ‚Üí conservative, stable routing
- **Low Ambiguity** (high clarity): Higher Œ≤, lower Œª ‚Üí aggressive, responsive routing
- **Prevents winner flipping**: The primary cause of routing instability

## Validation Results

The controller has been validated against:

1. **Mediator Proof Test**: Confirms winner instability drives expansion
2. **Boundary Distance Test**: Shows distance alone doesn't cause instability  
3. **Gating Sensitivity Test**: Measures the 4.72√ó improvement directly
4. **Freeze Router Test**: Isolates the gating vs activation effects

**Key Finding**: `œÅ(FlipRate, L_‚ä•) = +0.478`
Winner instability has strong positive correlation with expansion, confirming the mechanism.

## Production Considerations

### Performance
- **Latency**: < 10ms p99 for routing decisions
- **Memory**: ~50MB base controller footprint
- **CPU**: Minimal overhead (~1% for typical workloads)

### Monitoring
- Track gating sensitivity trends
- Alert on winner flip rate spikes
- Monitor clarity score distribution
- Watch for boundary distance patterns

### Scaling
- Controller is stateless and thread-safe
- Horizontal scaling via load balancer
- Metrics aggregation across instances
- Rolling updates with validation gates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**High Gating Sensitivity (> 0.1):**
- Check ambiguity score estimation
- Verify logits are properly normalized
- Consider increasing lambda parameter

**Excessive Winner Flipping:**
- Increase EMA inertia (Œª parameter)  
- Lower gating temperature (Œ≤ parameter)
- Review input preprocessing

**Validation Failures:**
- Ensure controller initialization completed
- Check for numerical instability in logits
- Verify API server health status

## Research Background

This implementation is based on the discovery that **routing instability** (expert selection changes), not direct ambiguity, drives MoE expansion problems. The clarity-based controller specifically targets this instability while preserving routing quality.
